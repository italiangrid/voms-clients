== NAME

vomsdir - The structure of the vomsdir VOMS server trust anchor directory

== SYNOPSIS

*/etc/grid-security/vomsdir* 

== DESCRIPTION

This manual page describes the structure of the _vomsdir_ VOMS server trust anchor
directory. The function of this directory is to keep local information about trusted VOMS servers
which is used to verify the signatures on the attributes issued by VOMS servers.

The _vomsdir_ directory is structured as follows:
----
<vomsdir>
   |
   |--vo1
   |
   |--vo2
   |
   |--vo3
   |
----
A subdirectory is created for each of the trusted VOs. Inside each VO directory two types of
files can be found:

* *LSC files*
An LSC file contains a description of the certificate chain of the certificate used by a VOMS server
to sign VOMS attributes.

* *X509 certificates* 
The certificate used by a VOMS server to sign attributes.

These files are commonly named using the following pattern:
----
<hostname>.lsc
<hostname>.pem
----
Where hostname is the host where the VOMS server is running.

When both lsc and pem files are present for a given VO and hostname, the lsc file takes precedence.

=== LSC file syntax

The LSC file contains a list of X.509 subject strings, one on each line, encoded in OpenSSL slash-separated syntax,
describing the certificate chain (up and including the CA that issued the certificate).
For instance, the voms.cnaf.infn.it VOMS server has the following LSC file:
----
/C=IT/O=INFN/OU=Host/L=CNAF/CN=voms.cnaf.infn.it
/C=IT/O=INFN/CN=INFN CA
----

== EXAMPLES
Assuming locally two VOs are trusted, the *cms* VO and the *cdf* VO, the */etc/grid-security/vomsdir* directory will be structured 
as follows:
----
/etc/grid-security/vomsdir
/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/cms
/etc/grid-security/vomsdir/cdf
----

The */etc/grid-security/vomsdir/cms* directory will contain the following files:
----
lcg-voms.cern.ch.lsc  
voms.cern.ch.lsc
----

The */etc/grid-security/vomsdir/cdf* directory will contain the following files:
----
voms-01.pd.infn.it.lsc  
voms.cnaf.infn.it.lsc  
voms.fnal.gov.lsc
----

The LSC files will contain descriptions of the certificate chains used by VOMS servers to sign attribute certificates.
